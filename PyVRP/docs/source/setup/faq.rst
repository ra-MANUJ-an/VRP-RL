How do I...
-----------

.. glossary::

   ... install the latest PyVRP from ``main`` without having to compile things myself?

      The latest prebuilt binaries can be found `here <https://github.com/PyVRP/PyVRP/actions/workflows/CD.yml>`_.

   ... compile PyVRP from source on Windows machines?

      None of the PyVRP developers have a functioning Windows development enviroment available, so we cannot help you troubleshoot this.
      If you have difficulty figuring out how to build PyVRP on Windows, consider using the `Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL) <https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/>`_ instead.
